## üßê About
This Project has been done during the Intermediate Course of The Odin Project (a free resource to learn web-dev). The main goal of this personal project is to have a good hand at major CSS display properties (Grid and Flex) and Layouting a complex web-page. this repo is hosted using Vercel and see the live-project click on the link in About section of the repo.

## üèÅ Getting Started
To get your own copy of the Project (for any reason you want or just to try and see some changes) : Fork the repo. Open the repo then in your choice of code editor and then assign the "index.html" a local network port and then open that port in your Browser. If you are using VSCode, then it will be much easier, just install the plugin named "Live Server" and you are good to go.

## üöÄ Features
- **Auto Grid Layout for the Main Dashboard** (which makes cards section resposnsive based on the number of cards given)
- **Fixed Side-bars and Navigation** (so that major links and routes are always visible to the users)
- **Overflow Scrolls** (for both the card-section and side-bars)
- **Custom Scrollbars** (for a minimal look and least possible distraction from the main content)

Note : Right now this project is more like on Version (1), I will be adding a lot of other features and functionalities in the future. So have a eye on the repo.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Design and Credits
The Design is a comibination 3 different Figma Files coming from 3 different designers (all their links are listed). I wanted the design to be simple yet feature-loaded so ended up combining them.

- Hover Effects on the link, cards and buttons
