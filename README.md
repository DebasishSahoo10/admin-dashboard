## üßê About
This Project has been done during the Intermediate Course of The Odin Project (a free resource to learn web-dev). The main goal of this personal project is to have a good hand at major CSS display properties (Grid and Flex) and Layouting a complex web-page. this repo is hosted using Vercel and see the live-project click on the link in About section of the repo.

## üöÄ Features
- **Auto Grid Layout for the Main Dashboard** (which makes cards section resposnsive based on the number of cards given)
- **Fixed Side-bars and Navigation** (so that major links and routes are always visible to the users)
- **Overflow Scrolls** (for both the card-section and side-bars)
- **Custom Scrollbars** (for a minimal look and least possible distraction from the main content)

Note : Right now this project is more like on Version (1), I will be adding a lot of other features and functionalities in the future. So have a eye on the repo.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Design and Credits
The Design is a comibination 3 different Figma Files coming from 3 different designers (all their links are listed). I wanted the design to be simple yet feature-loaded so ended up combining them.
